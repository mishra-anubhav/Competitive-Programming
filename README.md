## Month 1:
   Understanding the Big O:
    Example for Understanding - A class have 100 students in which you gave your en to one person. Now for finding out who have youe pen. There are following ways :
  * You go and ask the first person of the class, if he has the pen. Also, you ask this person about other 99 people in the classroom if they have that pen and so on,
This is what we call O(n2).
  * Going and asking each student individually is O(N).
  * Now I divide the class into two groups, then ask: “Is it on the left side, or the right side of the classroom?” Then I take that group and divide it into two and ask again, and so on. Repeat the process till you are left with one student who has your pen. This is what you mean by O(log n).

**NOTE: In asymptotic analysis we consider growth of algorithm in terms of input size. An algorithm X is said to be asymptotically better than Y if X takes smaller time than y for all input sizes n larger than a value n0 where n0 > 0**
